# PhotoAlbum

# Overview
This days most of us take hundreds of pictures weekly. With this numbers it's almost impossible to keep track of our best moment in life. Pictures need to be organized to be accessible; at the same time this isn't a trivial matter and could result in a tedious activity for the user.
Our web app intend to solve this issues, in particular is going to offer a way to classify pictures or groups of pictures by date, location, event, author and people in the picture. The classification will allow the user to retrieve the pictures using a search features and to create thematic albums. We already mention that this activity could be tedious so we would help the user by offering a auto-classification through a facial recognition feature and through a album suggestion feature.
